# TOP 14's 2022-2023 ranking prediction

Simple machine learning project aiming at predicting the ranking of the 2022-2023's TOP 14 season rugby.

The aim of the project was to build a program able to predict the ranking of the 2022-2023 TOP 14 's season using machine learning. 

There are 2 (two) Python Notbooks related to the project: [SCRAPPING](Scraping_LNR.ipynb) and [RANKING PREDICTION](Final_ranking_prediction.ipynb). 

## 1. Collect the data to train the models:
The Scraping_LNR.ipynb file' s aim is to collect the resultst of the previous reason from the official league web page. The models will be trained with these data. 


## 2. Predict the final ranking:
The Final_ranking_prediction.ipynb file' s aim is to create models to determine the final ranking.
